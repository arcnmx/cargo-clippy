# cargo-clippy

[![travis-badge][]][travis] [![license-badge][]][license]

`cargo clippy` runs [clippy] on the current project.
This is a fork of [cargo-check].

You may also pass additional parameters, like so:

    cargo clippy --release -- -Dclippy -Wclippy_pedantic


**NOTE:** requires nightly Rust.


## Installation

First compile with `cargo build --release`, then add
`target/release/cargo-clippy` into your `$PATH`.

**WARNING:** simply copying it is not enough; you must
specifically add the directory to your path, or use
a symbolic link instead.
